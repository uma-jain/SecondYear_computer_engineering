A translation process moves every point a constant distance in a specified direction. It can be described as a rigid motion. A translation can also be interpreted as the addition of a constant vector to every point, or as shifting the origin of the coordinate system.
Suppose, If point (X, Y) is to be translated by amount Dx and Dy to a new location (X’, Y’) then new coordinates can be obtained by adding Dx to X and Dy to Y as:

X' = Dx + X
Y' = Dy + Y   

:: In short add translation factor to each of our co-ordinate;

or P' = T + P where

P' = (X', Y'),
T = (Dx, Dy ),
P = (X, Y)
Here, P(X, Y) is the original point. T(Dx, Dy) is the translation factor, i.e. the amount by which the point will be translated. P'(X’, Y’) is the coordinates of point P after translation.
Examples:

Input : P[] = {5, 6}, T = {1, 1}
Output : P'[] = {6, 7}

Input : P[] = {8, 6}, T = {-1, -1}
Output : P'[] = {7, 5}
