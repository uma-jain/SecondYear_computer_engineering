We have to rotate an object by a given angle about a given pivot point and print the new co-ordinates.

In order to rotate an object we need to rotate each vertex of the figure individually.
On rotating a point P(x, y) by an angle A about the origin we get a point P'(x’, y’). The values of x’ and y’ can be calculated as follows:-

We know that,
x = rcosB, y = rsinB

x’ = rcos(A+B) = r(cosAcosB – sinAsinB) = rcosBcosA – rsinBsinA = xcosA – ysinA
y’ = rsin(A+B) = r(sinAcosB + cosAsinB) = rcosBsinA + rsinBcosA = xsinA + ycosA
